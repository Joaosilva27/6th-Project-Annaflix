# 6th-Project-Annaflix
A netflix inspired website using only HTML &amp; CSS.
I'm in the process of adding React to this webpage and turn it into a bigger project but as of right now it does not have any framework.

This webpage is very similiar to the older versions of Netflix back when it was more simple.

## Screenshots
### Heading
The heading section has a fixed header and a background image of the newest movie.

### Main body
The whole body of the page is filled by containers with images from series/movies and their respective category.
